Addition features to work on:
1. Add functionality to reorder exercises within a workout before pushing the workout to ActiveWorkoutPage
    https://github.com/gitim/react-native-sortable-list/
2. Add functionality to add a new exercise to a workout based on exercises existing in other workouts
    i.e. a search bar appears when you click add a workout and you can look up exercises, if its a new one
    you can add it manually.
